    This is an easy grilled peach dessert! I use a honey nut flavored cream
    cheese spread and it's wonderful! Drizzle a little extra honey after they're
    grilled and they're perfect!
  </h2>
  <p>Perfect dessert for a hard days work!</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>4 peaches, halved and pitted</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons clover honey</li>
    <li>1 cup soft cream cheese with honey and nuts</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat a grill for medium-high heat.</li>
    <li>
      Brush peaches with a light coating of oil. Place pit side down onto the
      grill. Grill for 5 minutes, or until the surfaces have nice grill marks.
      Turn the peaches over, and drizzle with a bit of honey. Place a dollop of
      the cream cheese spread in the place where the pit was. Grill for 2 to 3
      more minutes, or until the filling is warm. Serve immediately.
